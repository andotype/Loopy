# Loopy

Loopy is a layered color typeface. You can combine styles with outline, highlight, shadow and fill, and set them in any colors you like.

Loopy captures a kind of bubbly lettershapes that are familiar from comics, stickers and street art, but rarely seen in serious typography, and rarely given the attention to detail that they deserve. 

Systematically irregular, with sometimes looping outlines, Loopy is happily ignorant about logic or typographic etiquette.
